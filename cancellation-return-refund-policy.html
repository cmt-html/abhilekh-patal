                            <p class="pcontent-term mb-2 px-md-4 pb-2">2. National Archives of India will provide a quotation against each ROD Request of the user. The charges are based on the number of physical pages and the page size in each record. </p>
                            <p class="pcontent-term mb-2 px-md-4 pb-2">3. The user can either accept or decline the quotation against the specific ROD Request Number.</p>
                            <p class="pcontent-term mb-2 px-md-4 pb-2">4. The user cannot place order for selective records under a single ROD Request. The User will have to cancel the first ROD Request with multiple records and generate a new ROD Request with only the desired records. A fresh
                                quotation will be provided against this new ROD Request, which can be accepted by the user and the user can complete the payment transaction.
                                <p class="pcontent-term mb-2 px-md-4 pb-2">5. Once the user accepts the quotation and completes the payment transaction, no claim for order cancellation or refund will be entertained.</p>
                                <p class="pcontent-term mb-2 px-md-4 pb-2">6. In case the number of pages is higher in the digitized record, than the number of pages quoted for in the ROD Quotation provided initially, a link will be sent to the user to make the additional payment for the extra
                                    pages. </p>
                                <p class="pcontent-term mb-2 px-md-4 pb-2">7. The NAI makes every effort to provide accurate quotation however in some cases this might differ and is known only after the Digitization process is complete. </p>
                                <p class="pcontent-term mb-2 px-md-4 pb-2">8. No claim for Order Cancellation or Refund will be entertained at this stage. </p>

                                    The user can use this code from the same login id and avail the credit of the excess payment made in the next order.</p>
